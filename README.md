My old to-do list before I stopped using my pinephone

## To-Do
- [Customise virtual keyboard(s)](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Sxmo/Tips_and_Tricks#How_to_change_the_keyboard_layouts.3F_.28wvkbd.2Fwayland.29.3F)

- find a way to run anki on pinephone somehow
- investigate using vpn on phone
- look into blue light filter (redshift for wayland), greyscale and inverted (try out picom)
- Look into or make alarm clock (cli) app/script that goes even in suspend mode/when auto-suspend is on (vibrates and plays bird songs for wake up) (if I use an alarm (cli) app, make script to control/use it)

### Speaking Function
- Pinephone persistent environment variable (stored in /env/environment) for if I want speaking on or off
- When system starts turn speak function off by changing persistent environment variable (stored in /env/environment) to off and change status bar to show it is off
- Display in bar if speak is on or off
- Make script that turns on and off speaking variable
- SMS speak "Text, {contact/number}, {message contents}"
- Someone ringing me "Incoming call, {contact/number}"
- Change hooks that checks environment variable for speaking and then speak or not depending on the variable
